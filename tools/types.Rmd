# R's data types

When writing out a data frame, nanoparquet maps R's data types to Parquet
logical types. The following table is a summary of the mapping. For the
details see below.

R type   | Parquet type            | Default | Notes
:--------|:------------------------|:-------:|:----------------------------------------
character| STRING (BYTE_ARRAY)     | x       | I.e. STRSXP. Converted to UTF-8.
"        | BYTE_ARRAY              |         |
"        | FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY    |         |
"        | ENUM                    |         |
"        | UUID                    |         |
Date     | DATE                    | x       |
difftime | INT64                   | x       | If not hms::hms. Arrow metadata marks it as Duration(NS).
factor   | STRING                  | x       | Arrow metadata marks it as a factor.
"        | ENUM                    |         |
hms::hms | TIME(true, MILLIS)      | x       | Sub-milliseconds precision is lost.
integer  | INT(32, true)           | x       | I.e. INTSXP.
"        | INT64                   |         |
"        | INT96                   |         |
"        | DECIMAL (INT32)         |         |
"        | DECIMAL (INT64)         |         |
"        | INT(8, *)               |         |
"        | INT(16, *)              |         |
"        | INT(32, signed)         |         |
list     | BYTE_ARRAY              |         | Must be a list of raw vectors. Messing values are `NULL`.
"        | FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY    |         | Must be a list of raw vectors of the same length. Missing values are `NULL`.
logical  | BOOLEAN                 | x       | I.e. LGLSXP.
numeric  | DOUBLE                  | x       | I.e. REALSXP.
"        | INT96                   |         |
"        | FLOAT                   |         |
"        | DECIMAL (INT32)         |         |
"        | DECIMAL (INT64)         |         |
"        | INT(*, *)               |         |
"        | FLOAT16                 |         |
POSIXct  | TIMESTAMP(true, MICROS) | x       | Sub-microsecond precision is lost.

The non-default mappings can be selected via the `schema` argument. E.g.
to write out a factor column called 'name' as `ENUM`, use
```r
write_parquet(..., schema = parquet_schema(name = "ENUM"))
```

The detailed mapping rules are listed below, in order of preference.
These rules will likely change until nanoparquet reaches version 1.0.0.

1. Factors (i.e. vectors that inherit the *factor* class) are converted
   to character vectors using `as.character()`, then written as a
   `STRSXP` (character vector) type. The fact that a column is a factor
   is stored in the Arrow metadata (see below), unless the
   `nanoparquet.write_arrow_metadata` option is set to `FALSE`.
1. Dates (i.e. the `Date` class) is written as `DATE` logical type, which
   is an `INT32` type internally.
1. `hms` objects (from the hms package) are written as `TIME(true, MILLIS)`.
   logical type, which is internally the `INT32` Parquet type.
   Sub-milliseconds precision is lost.
1. `POSIXct` objects are written as `TIMESTAMP(true, MICROS)` logical type,
   which is internally the `INT64` Parquet type.
   Sub-microsecond precision is lost.
1. `difftime` objects (that are not `hms` objects, see above), are
   written as an `INT64` Parquet type, and noting in the Arrow metadata
   (see below) that this column has type `Duration` with `NANOSECONDS`
   unit.
1. Integer vectors (`INTSXP`) are written as `INT(32, true)` logical type,
   which corresponds to the `INT32` type.
1. Real vectors (`REALSXP`) are written as the `DOUBLE` type.
1. Character vectors (`STRSXP`) are written as the `STRING` logical type,
   which has the `BYTE_ARRAY` type. They are always converted to UTF-8
   before writing.
1. Logical vectors (`LGLSXP`) are written as the `BOOLEAN` type.
1. Other vectors error currently.

You can use [infer_parquet_schema()] on a data frame to map R data types
to Parquet data types.

To change the default R to Parquet mapping, use [parquet_schema()] and
the `schema` argument of [write_parquet()]. Currently supported
non-default mappings are:

- `integer` to `INT64`,
- `integer` to `INT96`,
- `double` to `INT96`,
- `double` to `FLOAT`,
- `character` to `BYTE_ARRAY`,
- `character` to `FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY`,
- `character` to `ENUM`,
- `factor` to `ENUM`,
- `integer` to `DECIAML` & `INT32`,
- `integer` to `DECIAML` & `INT64`,
- `double` to `DECIAML` & `INT32`,
- `double` to `DECIAML` & `INT64`,
- `integer` to `INT(8, *)`, `INT(16, *)`, `INT(32, signed)`,
- `double` to `INT(*, *)`,
- `character` to `UUID`,
- `double` to `FLOAT16`,
- `list` of `raw` vectors to `BYTE_ARRAY`,
- `list` of `raw` vectors to `FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY`.

# Parquet's data types

When reading a Parquet file nanoparquet also relies on logical types and
the Arrow metadata (if present, see below) in addition to the low level
data types. The following table summarizes the mappings. See more details
below.

Parquet type         | R type    | Notes
:--------------------|:----------|:---------------------------------------------
*Logical types*      |           |
BSON                 | character |
DATE                 | Date      |
DECIMAL              | numeric   | REALSXP, potentially losing precision.

INT(8, *)            | integer   |
INT(16, *)           | integer   |
INT(32, *)           | integer   | Large unsigned values may overflow!
INT(64, *)           | numeric   | REALSXP
INTERVAL             | list(raw) | Missing values are `NULL`.
JSON                 | character |
LIST                 |           | Not supported.
MAP                  |           | Not supported.
STRING               | factor    | If Arrow metadata says it is a factor. Also UTF8.
"                    | character | Otherwise. Also UTF8.
TIME                 | hms::hms  | Also TIME_MILLIS and TIME_MICROS.
TIMESTAMP            | POSIXct   | Also TIMESTAMP_MILLIS and TIMESTAMP_MICROS.
UUID                 | character | In `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` form.
UNKNOWN              |           | Not supported.
*Primitive types*    |           |
BOOLEAN              | logical   |
BYTE_ARRAY           | factor    | If Arrow metadata says it is a factor.
"                    | list(raw) | Otherwise. Missing values are `NULL`.
DOUBLE               | numeric   | REALSXP
FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY | list(raw) | Missing values are `NULL`.
FLOAT                | numeric   | REALSXP
INT32                | integer   |
INT64                | numeric   | REALSXP
INT96                | POSIXct   |

The exact rules are below. These rules will likely change until nanoparquet
reaches version 1.0.0.

1. The `BOOLEAN` type is read as a logical vector (`LGLSXP`).
1. The `STRING` logical type and the `UTF8` converted type is read as
   a character vector with UTF-8 encoding.
1. The `DATE` logical type and the `DATE` converted type are read as a
   `Date` R object.
1. The `TIME` logical type and the `TIME_MILLIS` and `TIME_MICROS`
   converted types are read as an `hms` object, see the hms package.
1. The `TIMESTAMP` logical type and the `TIMESTAMP_MILLIS` and
   `TIMESTAMP_MICROS` converted types are read as `POSIXct` objects.
   If the logical type has the `UTC` flag set, then the time zone of the
   `POSIXct` object is set to `UTC`.
1. `INT32` is read as an integer vector (`INTSXP`).
1. `INT64`, `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` are read as real vectors (`REALSXP`).
1. `INT96` is read as a `POSIXct` read vector with the `tzone` attribute
   set to `"UTC"`. It was an old convention to store time stamps as
   `INT96` objects.
1. The `DECIMAL` converted type (`FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY` or `BYTE_ARRAY`
   type) is read as a real vector (`REALSXP`), potentially losing
   precision.
1. The `ENUM` logical type is read as a character vector.
1. The `UUID` logical type is read as a character vector that uses the
   `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff` form.
1. The `FLOAT16` logical type is read as a real vector (`REALSXP`).
1. `BYTE_ARRAY` is read as a *factor* object if the file was written
   by Arrow and the original data type of the column was a factor.
   (See 'The Arrow metadata below.)
1. Otherwise `BYTE_ARRAY` is read a list of raw vectors, with missing
   values denoted by `NULL`.

Other logical and converted types are read as their annotated low level
types:

1. `INT(8, true)`, `INT(16, true)` and `INT(32, true)` are read as
   integer vectors because they are `INT32` internally in Parquet.
1. `INT(64, true)` is read as a real vector (`REALSXP`).
1. Unsigned integer types `INT(8, false)`, `INT(16, false)` and
   `INT(32, false)` are read as integer vectors (`INTSXP`). Large
   positive values may overflow into negative values, this is a known
   issue that we will fix.
1. `INT(64, false)` is read as a real vector (`REALSXP`). Large
   positive values may overflow into negative values, this is a known
   issue that we will fix.
1. `INTERVAL` is a fixed length byte array, and nanoparquet reads it as
   a list of raw vectors. Missing values are denoted by `NULL`.
1. `JSON` columns are read as character vectors (`STRSXP`).
1. `BSON` columns are read as raw vectors (`RAWSXP`).

These types are not yet supported:

1. Nested types (`LIST`, `MAP`) are not supported.
1. The `UNKNOWN` logical type is not supported.

You can use the [read_parquet_schema()] function to see how R would read
the columns of a Parquet file. Look at the `r_type` column.

# The Arrow metadata

Apache Arrow (i.e. the arrow R package) adds additional metadata to
Parquet files when writing them in `arrow::write_parquet()`. Then,
when reading the file in `arrow::read_parquet()`, it uses this metadata
to recreate the same Arrow and R data types as before writing.

`nanoparquet::write_parquet()` also adds the Arrow metadata to Parquet
files, unless the `nanoparquet.write_arrow_metadata` option is set to
`FALSE`.

Similarly, `nanoparquet::read_parquet()` uses the Arrow metadata in the
Parquet file (if present), unless the `nanoparquet.use_arrow_metadata`
option is set to FALSE.

The Arrow metadata is stored in the file level key-value metadata, with
key `ARROW:schema`.

Currently nanoparquet uses the Arrow metadata for two things:
- It uses it to detect factors. Without the Arrow metadata factors are
  read as string vectors.
- It uses it to detect `difftime` objects. Without the arrow metadata
  these are read as `INT64` columns, containing the time difference in
  nanoseconds.
